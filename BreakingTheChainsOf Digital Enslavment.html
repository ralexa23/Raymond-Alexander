    <p class="credits">My social cause is to spread awareness and resolutions to the underestimated reality of "Digital Slavery".This video and image should give you insight.According to Dr. Lisa Strohman a  licensed psychologist and the founder of Digital Citizen Academy, an organization addressing the issue of technology addiction and overuse;"Since ancient times, humans have always desired a better quality of life, leading to the continuous development of new and advanced items to navigate the physical world. According to vinegar, the term "technology" originates from the Greek words "technologia," which combines "techne" (craft) and "logia" (say). Therefore, technology can be viewed as the expression of craftsmanship and the extent to which society controls its surroundings. The agricultural system has been a pivotal technological breakthrough, laying the groundwork for future innovations. It has spurred the need for labor, transportation, and disputes over land ownership. The necessity for transportation led to the creation of vehicles, while the demand for skilled labor gave rise to mechanical robots. Similarly, the requirement for more land led to the development of sophisticated weapons. Although technology has enhanced human life, it also carries potential risks. The impact of technology can adversely affect individuals physically, mentally, and socially, emphasizing the importance of using it responsibly. Many technological issues stem from inventors neglecting the possible negative consequences of their creations. For example, while cars were initially celebrated as a superior alternative to horseback riding in the early 1900s, the proliferation of automobiles resulted in noise and air pollution, with carbon monoxide emissions threatening human health and the environment. The reliance on imported oil for fuel further contributes to accidents like the Exxon oil spill, highlighting the detrimental effects of technology on society."</p>
